## 1. System Overview

The Cemetery Lot Management System handles the complete lifecycle of cemetery lot sales, from reservation through payment completion or forfeiture. The system differentiates between **Pre-Need** (advance planning) and **At-Need** (immediate burial requirement) purchases, each with distinct rules and pricing.

**Key Technologies:**

- **Monitoring System:** Supabase Cron Jobs + Edge Functions
- **Automated Processing:** Warning level progression, penalty calculations, timeout management

---

## 2. Lot Classifications

All lot classifications include configurable internment capacity (e.g., 4 skeletal, 2 fresh).

| Classification    | Base Price  | Internment Capacity                      |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Diamond**       | â‚±150,000.00 | Configurable (e.g., 4 skeletal, 2 fresh) |
| **Platinum**      | â‚±120,000.00 | Configurable (e.g., 4 skeletal, 2 fresh) |
| **Family Estate** | â‚±300,000.00 | Configurable (e.g., 4 skeletal, 2 fresh) |
| **Gold**          | â‚±75,000.00  | Configurable (e.g., 4 skeletal, 2 fresh) |

**Note:** Additional classifications can be added through the admin panel. Both internment capacity numbers are configurable per classification.

**Non-Cash**

### 5.2 Payment Status Workflow (PAY-002)

**When Any Amount + Non-Cash:**

- Lot Status: **Partial**
- Payment Status: **Pending Verification**
- Awaits admin approval
- If approved â†’ Verified â†’ May enter warning system if not full payment
- If rejected â†’ Failed

**Example:**

1. Customer pays â‚±50,000 down payment via GCash
2. Status becomes: Partial + Pending Verification
3. Admin reviews transaction proof
4. Admin approves â†’ Status: Partial + Verified
5. Warning level system begins monitoring due dates

---

## 6. Warning Level System

### 6.1 Pre-Need Warning Levels (LOT-005)

The system automatically tracks payment due dates and escalates warning levels:

| Level          | Status              | Days Overdue | Action        | Penalty |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------- |
| ðŸŸ¢ **Level 1** | Active              | â‰¤0 days      | Normal        | None    |
| ðŸŸ¡ **Level 2** | Grace Period        | 1-7 days     | Reminder      | None    |
| ðŸŸ  **Level 3** | Overdue             | 8-29 days    | Warning       | Applied |
| ðŸ”µ **Level 4** | First Warning       | 30-59 days   | Urgent notice | Applied |
| ðŸ”´ **Level 5** | Final Warning       | 60-89 days   | Final notice  | Applied |
| âš« **Level 6**  | Forfeiture Eligible | 90+ days     | Admin review  | Applied |

**Grace Period Details (PAY-005):**

- Duration: 7 days after due date
- No penalties applied during grace period
- Customer receives gentle reminders
- Only applies to Pre-Need installment plans

**Example Timeline:**

- Due date: October 25

| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸŸ£ **Level 7** | Manual Review | 72+ hours overdue | Payment processing BLOCKED - Requires admin intervention |

**Key Differences:**

```
Penalty = Monthly Payment Ã— 2% Ã— Penalty Months
```

**Configuration:**

- Default rate: 2% monthly (configurable)
- Grace period: 7 days (no penalties)
- Only applies to Pre-Need purchases

### 7.2 Calculation Example

**Scenario:**

- Monthly payment: â‚±5,000
- Due date: October 25
- Current date: November 30 (36 days overdue)

**Step 1: Determine penalty period**

- Days overdue: 36 days
- Grace period: 7 days (no penalty)
- Penalty days: 36 - 7 = 29 days
- Penalty months: 29 days Ã· 30 = 0.97 months

**Step 2: Calculate penalty**

- Penalty = â‚±5,000 Ã— 2% Ã— 0.97
- Penalty = â‚±5,000 Ã— 0.02 Ã— 0.97
- **Penalty = â‚±97.00**

**Step 3: Total amount due**

- Monthly payment: â‚±5,000.00
- Penalty: â‚±97.00
- **Total due: â‚±5,097.00**

### 7.3 Penalty Display in Payment Processing

**Warning Levels Showing Penalty:**

- Level 3: Overdue (8-29 days) â†’ Show penalty field
- Level 4: First Warning (30-59 days) â†’ Show penalty field
- Level 5: Final Warning (60-89 days) â†’ Show penalty field
- Level 6: Forfeiture Eligible (90+ days) â†’ Show penalty field

**Warning Levels WITHOUT Penalty:**
